/*object oriented program
oop is a concept of programming that emphasize the development of software basing on real world objects
concepts of oop: classes. objects,polymopism.],abstraction,encapsolation and inheritance*/
//class vs objects;
// a class is a blue print of an object and  an object is an instance of a class
//a class is a singular that contains plural details with in that class ie students(class) student(members of the class)
// a class shd have xtic features that are going to be taken up by the objects
//objects are created in class
//classes give us objests, objects can be indepedent, 

// a class gotten from another class becomes a derived class i.e, you can have a super/base/parent class and any
//Abstraction; is the ability by a class to hide some of its details, so that you can concentrate on it
// e.g capturing Africa as a class, then consider all countries as objects
//Astraction helps us to identify and also create objects

/*ENCAPSUALTION;
is the process of building data and methods that change the data as one.
making access to the data impossible without
the properties of an object private, you expose only the methods used to get or modify the object properties

POLYMOTHISM;
is the ability by an object to take on two or more form 

Identifying objects of a class;
eg doreen is a student
